//! Type-level utilities for guiding the construction of [`Transaction`](super::Transaction).

/// restricted to a particular state.

/// For example, the [`Transaction::sign`](super::Transaction::sign) method is only available in the state
/// [`ReadyForSigning`]. This ensures that the body is not inadvertently modified once constructed,
/// as it would invalidate all existing signatures.
