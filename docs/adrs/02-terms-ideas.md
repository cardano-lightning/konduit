## Context

How to calculate fees and decide whether or not serve consumer(s)?

## Decision

TBC

Fees depends on:

- Min on cost of sub if done now. In a way that is not possible to incentivised
  to be abused.
- Many unresolved cheques locally to a channel.
- Many unresolved cheques globally.
- Insufficiently confirmed retainers (locally and globally)
- longer route (longer timeout) ==> bigger exposure to price exposure

Simplified version:

- flat + linear
