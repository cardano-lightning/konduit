The [`log.md`] document is the project log. Core contributors are asked to
provide regular (ie weekly when things are running a pace) updates to this doc
addressing:

- What did you work on this week? (little prose, mostly links to PR, docs,
  source code, ..)
- What outcome/key result did it support?
- What's immediately next?
